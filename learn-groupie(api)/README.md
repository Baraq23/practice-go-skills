# Groupie Trackern Visualization

## Project Overview
Groupie Tracker is a web application that fetches and displays data from a given API to showcase information about various bands and artists. The project involves handling and visualizing data from multiple API endpoints, creating a user-friendly interface, and implementing a client-server interaction feature.

## Features
- **Artist Information**: Display details about bands and artists, including name, image, founding year, first album release date, and members.
- **Concert Locations**: Show past and upcoming concert locations.
- **Concert Dates**: Provide details about concert dates.
- **Data Relations**: Connect and integrate artists, dates, and locations into a comprehensive display.
- **Event Handling**: Implement client-server communication to trigger actions based on user interactions.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Present data using lists, tables, cards, and other UI elements.

## API Structure
The project relies on an API consisting of four main parts:
1. **Artists**: Contains general information about bands and artists.
2. **Locations**: Stores concert locations.
3. **Dates**: Contains concert dates.
4. **Relation**: Links artists with their respective locations and dates.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Written in Go (Golang)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **Client-Server Communication**: RESTful API requests

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/barraotieno/groupie-tracker-visualizations
   cd groupie-tracker
   ```
2. Run the backend server:
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```
3. Open the website in your browser to interact with the data.

## Project Requirements
- The backend must be implemented in Go.
- The website and server should not crash under any circumstances.
- Proper error handling must be implemented.
- Follow best coding practices.
- Unit test files are recommended.
- Only standard Go packages are allowed.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helps in understanding:
- Data manipulation and storage.
- JSON handling and processing.
- HTML and frontend design.
- Event creation and client-server interaction.
- Backend development in Go.
