# Groupie Trackers Project Report
### Introduction

The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly website that interacts with a RESTful API, retrieves data about artists and bands, and presents this information in a visually appealing and organized manner. The backend was developed using Go, and the frontend was designed to allow for intuitive interactions, including client-server communication through events or actions triggered by the user.

### Project Overview

The project meet the following objectives:

1. Data Retrieval:
- Integrating with a given API to fetch data about bands and artists.

2. Data Presentation:
- Displaying the retrieved data in various formats, such as cards, tables, and lists.

3. Event/Action Handling:
- Implementing client-side actions that communicate with the server and trigger responses.

4. Client-Server Interaction:
- Building a seamless communication system between the client and server using Go.

### API Structure

The provided API consisted of four main parts:

1. **Artists:**
- Contains information about bands and artists, including their names, images, the year they began their activity, the date of their first album, and their members.

2. **Locations:**
- Contains data regarding their past and/or upcoming concert locations.

3. **Dates:**
- Holds information about their past and/or upcoming concert dates.

4. **Relation:**
- Links the other parts (artists, dates, locations) together.

### Approach to Implementation

The project was divided into key stages: backend development, frontend design, API integration, and event handling.

* Backend Development

The backend of the project was written entirely in Go to ensure stability, efficiency, and ease of deployment. The core responsibilities of the backend included:

*API Requests and Data Handling:* The Go server made HTTP requests to the API, retrieved the JSON data, and processed it. This data was parsed, and relevant portions were sent to the frontend for display.

*Error Handling:* Robust error handling was implemented to ensure that the server handled issues like failed API requests, incorrect data formats, and connectivity issues without crashing.

*Best Practices:* The code adhered to good coding practices, including modularization, proper error handling, and the use of Go's standard libraries.

*Testing:* Unit tests were created for critical functions, especially those handling data retrieval and client-server interaction. This ensured the code's reliability and maintainability.

* Frontend Development

The frontend focused on displaying the retrieved information from the API in a user-friendly manner. The key steps included:

*Data Visualization:* The data was presented in various formats, such as:
- Cards displaying artist information.
- Tables listing concert dates and locations.
- Lists showing the band members and their roles.

*Responsive Design:* Care was taken to ensure that the website was responsive, working well on both desktop and mobile platforms.

*Data Interactivity:* Filters and sorting options were provided to allow users to easily browse and navigate the large amount of data.

* API Integration

API integration was a critical aspect of the project. The following tasks were performed during this phase:

*Fetching Data:* The backend utilized Go's http package to send GET requests to the API. The response was received in JSON format and parsed for specific fields.

*Data Management:* The JSON data was structured to match the needs of the frontend, allowing for easy display and interaction.

*Handling Multiple API Endpoints:* Since the API was divided into multiple endpoints (artists, locations, dates, relations), careful coordination was required to link the data accurately. This involved using the relation data to associate artists with their concerts and locations.

* Event/Action Handling

An essential feature of the project was the implementation of an event/action system. This system allowed users to trigger actions on the client-side that communicated with the server:

*Client-Server Communication:* A core action was designed to allow users to request additional information about a band (e.g., concert details, member biographies). When triggered, the frontend would send a request to the Go server, which would retrieve the relevant data from the API and send it back to the client.

*Request-Response Model:* This followed a classic request-response model, where the client initiates a request and the server responds with the requested data.

### Challenges and Solutions

**API Data Consistency:**
- *Challenge:* The API had different endpoints with related but separate data (artists, locations, dates).
- *Solution:* The relation endpoint was carefully utilized to ensure that artist data was accurately associated with their concert dates and locations.

**Error Handling:**
- *Challenge:* Ensuring that the server and site did not crash when encountering errors.
- *Solution:* Extensive error handling mechanisms were built to deal with failed API requests, parsing issues, and server downtime, ensuring the site remained functional.

**Frontend Responsiveness:**
- *Challenge:* Creating a frontend that would display large amounts of data without overwhelming the user.
- *Solution:* Data visualization techniques, such as cards, tables, and lists, were used to break down the data into digestible segments. Filtering and sorting options were also added.

### Testing

Unit testing was implemented for the backend to ensure that the code handling API requests, JSON parsing, and client-server communication was working as expected. Tests were also performed on the frontend to check the responsiveness and functionality of data visualizations.

### Conclusion

The Groupie Trackers project successfully met the stated objectives by building a user-friendly website that retrieves and displays data about artists and concerts from a RESTful API. The backend, written in Go, ensures robust data retrieval and error handling, while the frontend provides intuitive and interactive data visualizations. The project also features client-server communication, allowing users to trigger actions that fetch additional data from the API, further enhancing the user experience.
